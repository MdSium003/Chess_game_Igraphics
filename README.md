Chess Game (1-1 Project)
This is my first GAME Project. Although I didn’t find creating a Chess game very easy, I started with small tasks from the beginning. Even though it was quite challenging, the part I enjoyed the most in 1-1 was working on the project. My Project Supervisor also encouraged me a lot throughout the process. I learned so much from this project! ❤️❤️
